## Project Idea:
We intend to improve public transportation in Nepal using AI. We are aware of the difficulties travelers face, such as the unavailability of vehicles in uniform time and concerns about safety. Our project leverages face recognition technology to make using public transportation more convenient. When a passenger approaches the ticketing gate or boarding point, our technology scans their faces for verification. Passengers may quickly and simply register their faces. This reduces waiting times and increases overall security by doing away with the requirement for actual tickets or smartcards. Our working prototype demonstrates how easy, quick, and efficient this approach is. By implementing face recognition, we hope to enhance the user experience and increase the effectiveness and security of public transit in Nepal.
